CVAPP is an application in python that identifies objects in real time from video sources using computer vision. 
It can be used for surveillance in hotels, hospitals, airports or even shops. Identify objects with high precision. It allows to create automatisms or rules according to the detected object.

Objects detected: 

person, motorcycle, plane, boat, bus, train, car, motorcycle, traffic light, STOP sign, bank, cat, dog, cow, horse, sheep, bear, backpack, umbrella, knife, spoon, fork, apple, banana, orange, watermelon, chili, chicken, hot dog, pizza, donut, cake, chair, table, dog, painting, television, remote control, microwave, toaster, refrigerator, book, clock, washing machine, blender, shaving kit, shower, cash register, computer, microwave, television, iron, broom, sink, towel, toothbrush, comb.


## INSTALLATION:

Currently no compiled version of CVAPP is available because the project is still under development. (Soon)

  1. Clone repository : ``` $ git clone https://github.com/flowese/Computer-Vision-APP.git ```
  2. Access repository directory : ``` $ cd Computer-Vision-APP/ ```
  3. Install the requirements: ``` $ pip install -r requirements.txt ```
  4. Execute app: ``` $ python CVAPP.py ```
